# Kijani Webdesign

## Description
This is a repository to experiment with the design of the [Kijani Blog](http://blog.kijani.co) and also for the general [Kijani Website](http://kijani.co) in the future.

This is not supposed to host the actual code for the Kijani Blog and the Kijani Website, which are hosted at:
- [dudheit314/kijani-blog](https://github.com/dudheit314/kijani-blog)
- [mrloh/kijani.ngo](https://github.com/MrLoh/kijani.ngo)

Feel free to contribute to this by sending me pull requests.

## Requirements

This repository only includes Sass files, please compile with the latest Sass. The code has been written with [Brackets](http://brackets.io), which I can recommend for editing this as well. Sass compiling can then easily be done with the [Bracket Sass Plugin](https://github.com/jasonsanjose/brackets-sass).

The code is only optimized for Webkit Browsers, i.e. Chrome and Safari. Since this is not for actual distribution, let's keep it like that for simplicity sake. 

This does not include font files. To work properly you need to install the Fonts Bree, Nimrod und Yummo. Please contact me, if you need the fonts I can't distribute them publicly.
